                    Welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm Roberta and I have recently discovered a profound
                    passion for coding and front-end development. Eager to embrace this newfound love, I am embarking on a career transition
                    into the tech industry.

            <p>
                As a dedicated individual, I am proud to be a member of the Golden Key International Honor Society, a testament to my
                exceptional academic abilities. My commitment to continuous learning led me to become an alumna of the SheCodes coding
                workshop for women, where I successfully completed both the introductory and web development bootcamps.
                Currently, I am further expanding my skill set by enrolling in the SheCodes Responsive Web Design workshop. These
                experiences reflect my passion for excellence, bridging academia and technology to create a well-rounded professional
                profile.

                     Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and Criminology, 
                     I bring a deep understanding of human behavior and societal dynamics

                     through a Master's degree in Disaster Management from the prestigious University of the Free State.
                    Join me on this exciting journey where I bridge the worlds of Psychology, Criminology, Disaster
                    Management, and technology to create meaningful and user-centric digital solutions.
