                <p>
                    I am a graduate with a Master's degree in Disaster Management, where my focus was on mitigating the impact
                    of natural and man-made crises. Despite my expertise in Disaster Management, I have recently discovered a profound
                    passion for coding and front-end development. Eager to embrace this newfound love, I am embarking on a career transition
                    into the tech industry. I have been part of the SheCodes Coding Workshop for the past 6 months and I am currently improving my skills in Responsive web design.
